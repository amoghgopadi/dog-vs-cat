# Dogs vs Cats
This is a training project used to classify cats from dogs using the famous Dogs-vs-Cats Dataset from Kaggle. The final accuracies obtained are 97% training accuracy and 93% validation accuracy. This project is for beginners to learn and play around with neural networks.

## General info
This project can be used by beginners to learn and play around neural networks without the need of setting up in their local system. The motivation for this project is to get a head start in the field of Deep Learning and learn how to build Convolutional Neural Networks as well as perform transfer learning. 

## Technologies
* Python - version 3.7
* Keras - version 2.4.3

## Setup
The setup for this project is really simple. Open the Google colaboratory link in each of the .ipynb file uploaded. The only other requirement is the Kaggle.json file for authorizing API access to Kaggle datasets. 

Here is the link on how to access the Kaggle.json file - https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api#getting-started-installation-&-authentication

## Content
The two notebooks in this project are Dogs_vs_Cats.ipynb and TransferLearning.ipynb. The first notebook implements a custom neural network inspired by VGG-16. The second notebook uses transfer learning of VGG-16 to perform better on the given dataset.
